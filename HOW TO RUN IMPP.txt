Inverted Index Project Documentation
This project implements an inverted index and a positional index in TypeScript, designed to efficiently handle queries over a collection of text documents. The project is primarily aimed at indexing and querying research papers, but it can be adapted for various text-based applications.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager)
Setup
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run npm install to install the project dependencies.
Running the Project
To run the project and perform indexing and querying tasks, follow these steps:

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Execute the command npm run start:dev to initiate the project.
Usage
Once the project is running, you can perform various tasks such as:

Building the inverted index: This process involves parsing the text documents, tokenizing them, and creating an inverted index that maps each unique word to the documents where it appears.

To build the inverted index, execute the BuildIndex method from the InvertedIndex class.
Running queries:

For AND queries: Use the runAndQuery method from the InvertedIndex class, providing the query string as an argument.
For OR queries: Use the runOrQuery method, similar to the AND query.
For NOT queries: Utilize the runNotQuery method.
For proximity queries: Employ the proximityQuery method, specifying the terms and proximity value.
Example Queries
Here are some example queries you can execute:

AND Query: feature AND selection AND redundancy
OR Query: transformer OR model
NOT Query: NOT model
Proximity Query: artificial intelligence, proximity: 3
Additional Notes
The project includes detailed TypeScript code with comments for clarity and maintainability.
Ensure that your text documents are stored in the designated directory (./ResearchPapers/) and adhere to the expected format.
